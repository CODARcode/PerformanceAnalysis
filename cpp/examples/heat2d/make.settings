## Setup for your system to build the C++ examples
#
# We need the following information:
#  - location of the ADIOS v2 installation
#  - the C++ compiler, C++-11 compatible
#    - this should be the MPI C++ compiler if you built ADIOS with MPI
#  - compiler flags if necessary to make the build work on your system
#  - linker flags if necessary to make the build work on your system
#
# Optional information to build more stuff
#  - location of the VTK-m installation 

#
# ADIOS v2 installation
#
override ADIOS2_DIR=/opt/adios2

#
# C++ settings
#
CXX=mpic++
CXXFLAGS=-g -std=gnu++11 -O2
LDFLAGS=-g  -O2

#
# VTK-m settings (need separate include and libraries)
#
# set USE_VTKM to OFF if you don't have VTK-m 
USE_VTKM=OFF
override VTKM_DIR=/opt/vtk-m
override VTKM_INC=-I${VTKM_DIR}/include/vtkm-1.2
